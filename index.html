            <p class="proj-text">I live in NYC and I wanted to research one of the biggest issues that I see everyday which is Trash. 
                Trash overflows the city constantly and although some solutions are already being implemented I wanted to see if there was a solution that 
                could solve that problem that hasn’t already been thought of. That is why over the summer I connected with multiple people at New York City’s 
                department of Sanitation and brainstormed solutions which could be implemented in the future. (Press Here to see my presentation at the summer symposium). </p>
