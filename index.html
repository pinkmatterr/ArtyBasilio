            <p class="proj-text">I live in NYC and I wanted to research one of the biggest issues that I see everyday which is Trash. 
                Trash overflows the city constantly and although some solutions are already being implemented I wanted to see if there was a solution that 
                could solve that problem that hasn’t already been thought of. That is why over the summer I connected with multiple people at New York City’s 
                department of Sanitation and brainstormed solutions which could be implemented in the future. </p>
